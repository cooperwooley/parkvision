1. Project Summary (1-2 paragraphs)
ParkVision is a smart parking management system that aims to reduce inefficiency in high-traffic parking areas through real-time vehicle detection and occupancy tracking. 
The system uses computer vision to process live camera feeds, detect parked vehicles, and visually map their positions onto a user-friendly dashboard. 
This allows drivers to locate available spots more easily while giving administrators real-time insights into lot usage.

The original project scope has remained largely intact, but adjustments have been made in the choice of tools and technologies. 
While the initial plan included exploring multiple frameworks for the dashboard, we chose to move forward with React due to its component-based design and flexibility for future expansion. 
We also simplified some design elements early on to focus on delivering a clean and functional minimum viable product.

6. Timeline Assessment
Our initial project timeline outlined parallel development tracks for the computer vision system, backend API, and frontend dashboard. 
So far, we have been able to follow this timeline effectively. 
The React-based dashboard is progressing well, and weâ€™ve successfully set up the layout, integrated placeholder visuals, and begun preparing for backend data integration.

No major delays have occurred at this point. 
The upcoming development phases will focus on connecting the backend APIs and finalizing the vehicle detection pipeline. 
If progress continues at the current pace, we expect to stay on schedule and complete all key components in time for the final demo.
