1. User Stories

a. As a driver, I want to have a real-time web dashboard of available spots, so that I can find an open spot. (Must Have)
- There should be a number of available spots displayed.
- It should be clear which spots are available.
- The dashboard should update close to real time, to ensure it is accurate.

b. As a driver, I want to be able to filter different spots/locations, so that I can find a convienent spot. (Could Have)
- Can select different filters based on sections.
- Only spots that meet the filter should be displayed, and show the occupancy.

c. As a driver, I want to be able to reserve spots ahead, so that I can ensure I get a spot. (Won't Have)
- This would over complicate the system, and also would provide extra overhead for parking lot operations.

d. As a parking lot administrator, I want to receive alerts when the lot is getting full, so that I can handle overflow
parking issues. (Should Have)
- A notification should be triggered when the parking lot capacity exceeds a certain amount.
- The administrator should get a dashboard alert and possibly some type of text or email.

e. As a parking lot administrator, I want to monitor usage real time, so that I can easily manage the lot. (Must Have)
- The dashboard should display number of spots and a percent of how full it is.
- Summary of data to show stats like which lots are usually full, which days are most full, etc.

f. As a parking lot administrator, I want to be able to calibrate the camera, so that the vision model correctly
detects cars. (Must Have)
- The system must allow for homography transformation through various settings.
- The accuracy of the system should be around 90%.

g. As a Business/University, I want the system to be easy to use and setup, so that it won't require too much overhead. (Should Have)
- There should be clear documentation on how the system works and how to use it.
- Features like adjusting the homography should have a friendly built-in UI.

h. As a driver, I want to receive notifications when a spot becomes available in my selected parking lot, so that I can quickly claim a space. (Could Have)
- Users should be able to select a preferred area or lot.
- Notifications should be timely to ensure spots are still available.

i. As a driver, I want to view estimated wait times for occupied lots, so that I can plan my parking accordingly. (Could Have)
- The system should provide an estimated wait time based on historical data and current trends.
- Wait times should update regularly to reflect the changing conditions.

j. As a parking lot administrator, I want to export parking data as reports, so that I can analyze trends and improve efficiency. (Should Have)
- Reports should include metrics such as peak hours, busiest days, and average usage.
- The export format should support common file types.

k. As a parking lot administrator, I want to set restricted zones in the lot, so that I can designate special spaces for VIPs, staff, specific vehicles, or even metered spots. (Could Have)
- The system should allow admins to mark certain spaces as restricted.
- These restricted spaces should be clearly indicated on the dashboard.

l. As a Business/University, I want to customize the dashboard's branding, so that it aligns with our institution. (Could Have)
- The system should allow customization of colors and logos.
- Branding settings should be easily adjustable through the admin interface.

2. Project Scope

Parking inefficiency leads to congestion, wasted time, and frustration for drivers looking for available spots, especially
in high-traffic areas. Current solutions rely on sensors or manual monitoring, which can be costly and difficult to maintain.
A more scalable, automated system is needed to track real-time parking availability.

The minimum viable product will include:
A functional computer vision system that detects parked cars from a camera feed.
Homography transformation is used to correct distorted angles and is easily integrated into our dashboard.
A web-based dashboard displaying real-time parking availability and analytics.
A demo setup, with a test camera in a simulated/real parking lot, or with a video feed.

The minimum viable product will not include:
A reservation feature to reserve spots ahead of time.
A seperate Mobile App on top of the website.
Parking lot data prediction using AI.

The system will only intend to work with a clear and unobstructed view of the parking lot, and shouldn't expect to work otherwise.
The system may experience delays due to processing speed, so updates may not truly be "real time", but will be close. The dashboard
will be devloped to handle drivers and amdministrators, so there won't be complex user roles involved.
