What went well:
    - Completed the core Flask application and developed several REST API endpoints to begin integration with the frontend.
    - Built a working Docker setup that spins up the Flask app and PostgreSQL server with all dependencies installed.
    - Wrote multiple unit tests to validate endpoint functionality, parking spot detection, occupancy (car) detection algorithms, and database population.
    - Began extensive documentation:
        - Endpoint descriptions for frontend integration.
        - Docker usage instructions.
        - Overview of the computer vision approach.
    - Cleaned up the backend codebase by removing obsolete and primitive test code to improve maintainability.

What didn't go well:
    - Some features are still under development, including:
        - Metrics/analytics functionality and endpoints for parking trends.
        - Admin authentication and login functionality.
    - Integration with frotend is still partial.

Ideas/Actions:
    - Finish implementing:
        - Parking metric endpoints.
        - Admin login/authentication and respective routes.
    - Continue refining backend documentation.
    - Support frontend to begin integration with our systems.
